> Computational Creativity and Deep Generative Design: bridging the gap


This repo contains the ideas that were ideated during the workshop.


## Core Topics

Several abstracts were presented and in-depth discussions took place. The core topics that arose form the discussions were:

1. Evaluation Metrics
2. Co-creativity
3. Holes in the latent space
4. When we donâ€™t have big data
5. Personalisation

## Group breakout ideas

Six groups were formed from the attendees and each group chose a particular area to explore. These were:

1. Semi-autonomous co-creative partner.
2. Learning a latent space by definition, learns the training set. How can we creatively escape from the data set?
3. Build new architectures of co-creation centered on human experience.
4. Measure how the human is doing in co-creative systems.
5. Creative Systems with explainable component(s).
6. Interpretability

## You had to be there!
